### GAME LOGIC
the logic of the AI is:
1. move only while it's the computer turn
2. check for the ball Y coordinates and move according to it
3. try to hit in the center of the paddle

### FUTURE IMPROVMENTS
- add more features to the ball movment such as speed changing and more accurate 
- add extra logic to the AI such as hitting the paddle so the ball will move to the opposite side from where the player's paddle is
